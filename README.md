# Sentiment Classification of Movie Reviews

This project focuses on sentiment classification of movie reviews using machine learning techniques and feature engineering approaches. The goal is to classify movie reviews into different sentiment categories, such as negative, somewhat negative, neutral, somewhat positive, and positive.

---- Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset from Kaggle, which combines information from Socher et al.'s sentiment analysis and Pang and Lee's original movie review corpus sourced from Rotten Tomatoes.

---- Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The project explores preprocessing techniques like converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation, and stopwords.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Various feature extraction techniques are implemented, including bag-of-words, unigrams, bigrams, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, sentiment lexicons (SL), Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) features, and a combination of SL and LIWC features.
3. **Data Visualization**: The project incorporates data visualization techniques, such as sentiment distribution histograms, word frequency distribution histograms, word length distribution histograms, and word clouds, to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics and distribution of sentiments and words.
4. **Classification**: The performance of various classifiers, including Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest, is evaluated on different feature sets and data filtering conditions.
5. **Evaluation**: The project uses evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the performance of the classifiers.

---- Results

The project provides detailed performance of different feature sets and classifiers, the impact of data filtering, and the effectiveness of combining linguistic and sentiment-related features.
